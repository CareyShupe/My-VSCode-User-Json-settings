Here are my JSON settings for VSCode for PowerShell, Git, and GitLens. Feel free to use them, and I would love to hear your thoughts on my settings. My inspiration came from Justin Grote, Trevor Sullivan, various videos, a lot of YouTube, and Googling. I am still tweaking these settings and wondering why some settings are deprecated.
